        "### What is Prompt Engineering?\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompt engineering is a methodological approach to optimizing interactions with large language models (LLMs) through carefully crafted input instructions. It encompasses techniques for designing, refining, and evaluating prompts to achieve desired outputs. This practice combines understanding of model capabilities, systematic testing methods, and iterative refinement processes. Key aspects include format specification, context provision, and task decomposition.\n",

        "\n",
        "Basic Prompting Techniques:\n",
        "* Zero-shot prompting (direct questions without examples)\n",
        "* Few-shot prompting (providing examples)\n",
        "* Chain-of-thought prompting (breaking down reasoning steps)\n",
        "* Role-based prompting (\"Act as a...\")\n",
        "* Template-based prompting (consistent structure)\n",
        "\n",
        "Advanced Techniques:\n",
        "* Program-Aided Language (PAL) models\n",
        "* ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)\n",
        "* Tree-of-thought prompting\n",
        "* Self-consistency prompting\n",
        "* Step-back prompting (taking broader perspective)\n",
        "* PRISM Method (Parameterized Recursive Insight Synthesis Matrix)\n",
        "\n",
        "Adversarial Prompting:\n",
        "* Jailbreaking attempts\n",

        "# What is Adversarial Prompting\n",
        "\n",
        "Adversarial Prompting involves crafting inputs designed to test the limits, vulnerabilities, or biases of a language model. The goal can be to intentionally elicit unexpected, undesired, or incorrect responses, often to evaluate the model's robustness and safeguards\n",
